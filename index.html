    <h2>Pastor’s Reflection</h2>
    <p>
        Our hearts are shaped by what we treasure most. Jesus teaches us that earthly things fade, 
        but heavenly treasures endure forever. This exercise is not meant to shame or condemn, 
        but to help us honestly see what competes for the throne of our hearts. 
        When we place God first, everything else finds its proper place. 
        May this reflection draw you closer to Christ and deepen your desire to treasure Him above all.
